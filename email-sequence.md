## Email 1: Post-Webinar Thank You (24 Hours After Webinar)

### For Segment 1: Registered But Did Not Attend

**Subject**: We missed you at the BRV webinar - encore available

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

I noticed you registered for yesterday's Business Retirement Vault webinar but weren't able to join us. Life gets busy â€“ I completely understand.

The good news is we're hosting an encore presentation this Saturday at 11:00 AM Eastern. Many consultants found particular value in the section where I showed how to access retirement savings during contract gaps while still growing wealth tax-free.

If you're interested in seeing how this approach might work for your situation, you can reserve your spot for the encore here: [LINK]

See you Saturday,

P.S. If you're not able to make the encore, reply to this email and let me know - I might be able to share some resources that address your specific financial questions.
```

### For Segment 2: Attended But Did Not Apply

**Subject**: Thanks for joining the BRV webinar - your free guide

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Thank you for attending yesterday's Business Retirement Vault webinar. Your engagement and questions made the session even more valuable.

As promised, here's your free copy of the Business Retirement Vault guide: [LINK]

Many attendees were particularly interested in the comparison between traditional retirement accounts and the BRV strategy - especially the part about accessing funds during contract gaps without penalties while still growing wealth tax-free.

I noticed you haven't yet applied for a strategy session. These complimentary sessions are where we determine if this approach might work for your specific situation.

Would you be opposed to a brief call to explore whether this strategy might be a fit for you? I have a few spots available next week.

What days are typically bad for you during the week?

P.S. If you have any questions about what we covered in the webinar, feel free to reply to this email directly.

### For Segment 3: Applied But Did Not Qualify

**Subject**: Follow-up from your BRV application

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Thank you for attending our Business Retirement Vault webinar and completing the application. I appreciate your interest in exploring this strategy.

After reviewing your application, I noticed a few areas where the BRV strategy might not be the optimal fit for your current situation. This strategy tends to work best for those with:

- Consistent monthly savings capacity of $500+
- Income stability allowing for multi-year commitment
- Specific health qualifications that insurance companies require

That said, there are several approaches that might better align with your current situation. I'm happy to point you toward resources that might be more suitable for where you are in your financial journey.

Would you be open to sharing a bit more about your primary financial goals right now? That would help me recommend the most relevant resources.

P.S. Your situation may change in the future, and I'm happy to reassess qualification at that time if you're interested.

### For Segment 4: Attended, Applied, and Qualified

**Subject**: You're qualified for a BRV strategy session - next steps

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Great news! I've reviewed your Business Retirement Vault application, and you're qualified for a complimentary strategy session.

During our call, we'll:
1. Review your current financial situation
2. Identify your biggest opportunities for improvement
3. Determine if the BRV approach is right for your specific circumstances
4. Create a roadmap for implementation if it's a good fit

To make our time together as productive as possible, it would be helpful if you could have basic information about your current investments and savings readily available during our call.

I've set aside a few spots over the next week for these sessions. What days are typically bad for you during the week?

Looking forward to our conversation,
{{user.email_signature}}

P.S. These sessions are designed to be zero-pressure conversations focused on determining fit, not sales presentations.

## Email 2: Value-Add Content (3 Days After Webinar)

### For Segment 1: Registered But Did Not Attend (Who Haven't Registered for Encore)

**Subject**: Quick insight about tax-free retirement access

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

I wanted to share a key insight from our recent Business Retirement Vault webinar that many consultants found eye-opening.

Did you know there's a significant mathematical disadvantage built into traditional market-based retirement accounts? When you lose 20% in the market, you need a 25% gain just to break even. But if you lose 50%, you need a 100% gain just to get back to zero!

This recovery math becomes especially problematic for consultants whose income fluctuates with contracts. Market downturns often coincide with economic conditions that affect contract availability, creating a double financial challenge.

In Saturday's encore presentation, I'll show exactly how the Business Retirement Vault strategy addresses this problem, allowing you to:

1. Protect your principal from market losses
2. Participate in market gains
3. Access your money when you need it - like during contract gaps

Are you able to join us this Saturday at 11:00 AM Eastern? You can reserve your spot here: [LINK]

{{user.email_signature}}

P.S. If you can't make the encore but you're interested in these concepts, reply to this email and I'll share some additional resources that might help.
```

### For Segment 2: Attended But Did Not Apply (After Email 1)

**Subject**: A case study you might find relevant

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

After our Business Retirement Vault webinar, I was reminded of a client case study that might resonate with your situation.

One of my clients, Karen (name changed for privacy), is a consultant who was caught in the classic dilemma: choosing between retirement savings she couldn't touch and accessible cash that barely grew.

She implemented the BRV strategy three years ago. Last year, when she was between major contracts, her son needed $7,000 to pay off his car. Karen was able to access these funds tax-free from her policy in less than a week, while her money continued growing inside the policy as if she never touched it.

This kind of flexibility is exactly what many consultants need - the ability to access capital during contract transitions without derailing long-term growth.

If you're interested in exploring whether a similar approach might work for your situation, I still have a few strategy session spots available next week.

What days are typically bad for you during the week?

{{user.email_signature}}

P.S. Remember, the strategy session is a fit-finding conversation to determine if this approach aligns with your specific needs - not a sales pitch.
```

### For Segment 3: Applied But Did Not Qualify (After Email 1)

**Subject**: Alternative strategies you might consider

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Thank you for sharing more about your financial goals. Based on what you've told me, I wanted to suggest a few resources that might be more aligned with your current situation.

While the Business Retirement Vault strategy isn't the optimal fit right now, there are several approaches worth considering:

[Personalized recommendations based on their response to Email 1]

These resources aren't designed to replace personalized financial advice, but they provide valuable information that can help guide your next steps.

I'm happy to continue this conversation and provide additional suggestions as your situation evolves.

{{user.email_signature}}

P.S. Feel free to reach out if your circumstances change or if you have additional questions.
```

### For Segment 4: Attended, Applied, and Qualified (After Booking)

**Subject**: Preparing for your upcoming BRV strategy session

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

I'm looking forward to our Business Retirement Vault strategy session on [DATE].

To make our time together as productive as possible, I've attached a brief prep guide that outlines:

1. What to expect during our call
2. Documentation that would be helpful to have handy
3. Key questions we'll address together

This isn't homework - just a framework to help us make the most of our conversation.

One question I often discuss with clients is this: "What would your ideal relationship with money look like if all limitations were removed?" Your thoughts on this question will help me understand what matters most to you.

If you have any questions before our session, feel free to reply to this email.

Looking forward to our conversation,
{{user.email_signature}}

P.S. If anything comes up and you need to reschedule, just let me know. I understand that schedules can change, especially for consultants juggling multiple projects.
```

## Email 3: Final Follow-Up (5-7 Days After Webinar)

### For Segment 1: Registered But Did Not Attend (Who Haven't Registered for Encore)

**Subject**: Last chance to access BRV resources

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

I wanted to reach out one last time about the Business Retirement Vault strategy for consultants.

The most common feedback I hear from consultants who implement this strategy is, "I wish I'd known about this years ago." They're particularly drawn to the ability to:

- Access their money when contract work slows down
- Protect their wealth from market downturns
- Create tax-free income streams regardless of contract status

While our last encore presentation has passed, I'd still be happy to share some resources that explain how this approach works specifically for consultants with variable income.

Would you be interested in receiving this information? If so, just reply to this email with "Yes," and I'll send it your way.

If I don't hear back, I understand - you probably have a lot on your plate. I'll assume this isn't the right timing, and I won't continue to follow up.

{{user.email_signature}}

P.S. If your situation changes in the future and you become interested in exploring strategies that balance growth with accessibility, my door is always open.
```

### For Segment 2: Attended But Did Not Apply (Final Attempt)

**Subject**: One last question about your financial strategy

```
Hey {{contact.first_name}},

As a consultant myself, I understand how busy life can get. I wanted to check in one more time about the Business Retirement Vault strategy we discussed in the webinar.

A quick question: What's the biggest challenge you're currently facing when it comes to balancing long-term wealth building with the need for accessible capital during contract transitions?

Your answer would help me understand whether the BRV approach might address your specific situation - or whether there might be other strategies better suited to your needs.

If I don't hear back, I'll assume this isn't the right timing, and I won't continue to follow up. I respect your time and inbox too much for that.

{{user.email_signature}}

P.S. If your situation changes in the future and you become interested in strategies that offer both growth and accessibility, feel free to reach out anytime.
