### Opening
**[SLIDE: The Self Banking System - Title Slide]**

Hello everyone, and welcome! I'm Daniel Ladd, a Business Retirement Strategist, and I'm excited you've joined me today to learn about a powerful wealth-building strategy that most financial advisors don't talk about.

Before we begin, I'm excited to announce that everyone who stays until the end of today's webinar will receive a free copy of my Business Retirement Vault book, which normally sells for $49. And for those who qualify, I'll also be offering a complimentary strategy session to see if this approach might be right for your situation.

Today, we're tackling the consultant's dilemma head-on - how to stop choosing between easily accessible cash that barely grows and accounts that are high growth but barely accessible. I'll be showing you the Business Retirement Vault strategy, which eliminates this forced trade-off.

Before we dive in, I want to make it clear that this presentation isn't about high-risk investments or get-rich-quick schemes. Instead, it's about a systematic approach to building wealth that gives you control, protection, and tax advantages that most traditional financial strategies simply don't offer.

### About Me
**[SLIDE: About Me]**

Let me tell you a bit about myself.

My journey into financial strategy started in a pretty unusual place - studying physics at Florida Institute of Technology. That analytical training turned out to be incredibly valuable because it taught me how to break down complex problems and find solutions that aren't obvious at first glance.

I approach financial strategies like solving an equation - looking for the hidden variables that most people miss. As a Strategist, I've spent years developing expertise in areas that go beyond conventional thinking. In 2024 alone, I've helped over 30 clients implement the Business Retirement Vault strategy with remarkable results.

What really sets my approach apart is that I'm not trying to be a financial influencer or build a massive following. Unlike many people you might see doing webinars, I'm a practicing strategist who works directly with a select group of clients.

I deliberately keep my client base small and focused because this strategy requires customization and personal attention. I'm not here to sell courses to thousands of people - I'm here to work directly with professionals like you who meet specific criteria and can truly benefit from this approach.

This isn't for everyone, and that's by design. My goal isn't to help everyone with their financial problems - it's to provide exceptional results for the right clients who are a perfect fit for this strategy.

You know, I had this "aha moment" when I realized something that changed everything for me: most consultants are forced into an impossible choice - either save for retirement OR keep money liquid for contract gaps and business opportunities. The traditional financial planning sector isn't designed to solve this consultant-specific challenge.

So today, I want to show you what most consultants do with their money and why those approaches often fall short of expectations. Then we'll explore a strategy that gives you the best of both worlds - long-term growth AND immediate access when you need it.
