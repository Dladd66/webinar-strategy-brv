## INTRODUCTION (5-7 minutes)

### Opening
**[SLIDE: The Self Banking System - Title Slide]**
- "Hello everyone, and welcome! I'm Daniel Ladd, a Business Retirement Strategist, and I'm excited you've joined me today to learn about a powerful wealth-building strategy that most financial advisors don't talk about."
- "Before we begin, I'm excited to announce that everyone who stays until the end of today's webinar will receive a free copy of my Business Retirement Vault book, which normally sells for $49. And for those who qualify, I'll also be offering a complimentary strategy session to see if this approach might be right for your situation."
- "Today, we're tackling the consultant's dilemma head-on - how to stop choosing between easily accessible cash that barely grows and accounts that are high growth but barely accessible. I'll be showing you the Business Retirement Vault strategy, which eliminates this forced trade-off."
- "Before we dive in, I want to make it clear that this presentation isn't about high-risk investments or get-rich-quick schemes. Instead, it's about a systematic approach to building wealth that gives you control, protection, and tax advantages that most traditional financial strategies simply don't offer."

### About Me
**[SLIDE: About Me]**
- "Let me tell you a bit about myself."
- "My journey into financial strategy started in a pretty unusual place - studying physics at Florida Institute of Technology. That analytical training turned out to be incredibly valuable because it taught me how to break down complex problems and find solutions that aren't obvious at first glance."
- "I approach financial strategies like solving an equation - looking for the hidden variables that most people miss. As a Strategist, I've spent years developing expertise in areas that go beyond conventional thinking. In 2024 alone, I've helped over 30 clients implement the Business Retirement Vault strategy with remarkable results."
- "What really sets my approach apart is that I'm not trying to be a financial influencer or build a massive following. Unlike many people you might see doing webinars, I'm a practicing strategist who works directly with a select group of clients."
- "I deliberately keep my client base small and focused because this strategy requires customization and personal attention. I'm not here to sell courses to thousands of people - I'm here to work directly with professionals like you who meet specific criteria and can truly benefit from this approach."
- "This isn't for everyone, and that's by design. My goal isn't to help everyone with their financial problems - it's to provide exceptional results for the right clients who are a perfect fit for this strategy."
- "You know, I had this 'aha moment' when I realized something that changed everything for me: most consultants are forced into an impossible choice - either save for retirement OR keep money liquid for contract gaps and business opportunities. The traditional financial planning sector isn't designed to solve this consultant-specific challenge."
- "So today, I want to show you what most consultants do with their money and why those approaches often fall short of expectations. Then we'll explore a strategy that gives you the best of both worlds - long-term growth AND immediate access when you need it."

## THE PROBLEM WITH TRADITIONAL WEALTH BUILDING (10-12 minutes)

### The Example Setup
**[SLIDE: Our Example Setup]**
- "Before we dive into comparing different wealth-building approaches, let's establish the example we'll use throughout this presentation. We'll look at what happens when someone invests $25,000 per year for 10 years, for a total of $250,000. This could be a business owner, professional, or anyone who's serious about building wealth. Let's see how this same investment performs in different financial vehicles."

### Traditional Savings Accounts
**[SLIDE: The Problem with Traditional Investing]**
- "Let me share a real example that illustrates this problem perfectly. One of our clients, Karen, had been in consulting for over 30 years. After decades of hard work, she finally landed some high-paying contracts and started seeing significant income."
- "Like many consultants, she was cautious with her money. She wanted to make sure she had enough liquidity to cover the gaps between contracts, meet payroll for her team, and handle any unexpected expenses. So she did what seemed safest - she kept her money in checking and savings accounts."
- "By the time Karen came to me, she had accumulated hundreds of thousands just sitting in bank accounts. She thought she was being financially responsible, but in reality, her money was doing virtually nothing for her with that average return of just 0.45%."
- "Think about that - if you have $1 million sitting in savings accounts, you're earning just $4,500 a year in interest. Meanwhile, inflation is eroding your purchasing power at 3-4% annually. Karen was effectively losing money every year despite her impressive savings."
- "This is the dilemma so many consultants face. You work incredibly hard to earn that money during your active contracts, but then the fear of liquidity needs during contract gaps forces you to make decisions that sacrifice your long-term financial growth."
- "The average return in savings accounts is just 0.45%. If you contribute $250,000 over 10 years, that's about $2,083 per month, and your interest earned is only $5,625 total - just $562 per year in growth!"
- "I understand why consultants make this choice - you need that liquidity when contracts end or when opportunities arise. But this approach sacrifices your long-term financial future for short-term access."
- "Karen's situation is all too common. She was a successful consultant by any measure, but her fear of illiquidity was costing her hundreds of thousands in potential growth. What she needed wasn't an all-or-nothing approach, but a strategy that could provide both growth AND access."

### The 401(k)/IRA Approach
**[SLIDE: The 401(k)/IRA Strategy]**
- "On the other end of the spectrum, many consultants are told to put their money into traditional retirement accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, or TSP accounts. On the surface, this seems like a solid approach."
- "Take my client Bryan who's 50 years young. He had a successful military career and accumulated about $800,000 in his TSP account - which is impressive by any standard. He also had Roth IRAs, savings, and annuities."
- "On paper, he's done everything 'right' according to traditional financial advice. But here's the problem - he's not able to touch that TSP account until he's 59½ without facing significant penalties. Despite having saved diligently for decades and accumulated substantial wealth, he now finds himself in a frustrating position."
- "He wants to retire early and enjoy the fruits of his labor, but he's forced to either: Live off just his pension and limited personal savings until 59½, take on another job during what should be his retirement years, or pay hefty penalties to access his own money."
- "This is the fundamental flaw with traditional retirement accounts for consultants and professionals who value flexibility. Let's look at the numbers:"
- "With an average return around 7%, your $250,000 contribution over 10 years would grow to about $360,593. That's a gain of over $110,000 - which sounds impressive, right?"

**[SLIDE: BUT...]**
- "But there's a major problem with this picture... It's all before taxes! And you can't access it until retirement without significant penalties."
- "My client Bryan's story is just one example of the inflexibility built into these accounts. For consultants, this is even more problematic. When a contract ends unexpectedly or a fantastic business opportunity comes up that requires capital, your money is locked away. If you try to access it before 59½, you're hit with a 10% penalty plus ordinary income taxes. That can easily consume 30-40% of your hard-earned money. Would you be happy with your money being tied up like that?"
- "So while traditional retirement accounts seem attractive on the surface, they create a serious liquidity trap. They force you to choose between saving for retirement OR having access to your money when you need it - a choice no consultant should have to make."

### The Tax Problem
**[SLIDE: The Tax Problem]**
- "Here's where the rubber meets the road:"
- "If you followed the traditional approach with that $360,593 in your 401(k)/IRA, using the standard 4% withdrawal rule, you'd get about $14,424 per year before tax. After even just a modest tax rate, you're looking at roughly $12,925 per year - or about $1,077 per month."
- "Think about that for a moment. After 10 years of diligently contributing $2,083 per month, your monthly retirement income is only $1,077 - about half of what you were putting in each month! Have you ever done this math before? Most haven't."
- "And you face additional problems that make this traditional approach even less suitable:"
  - "Limited control over your money when you need it most"
  - "10% penalties for early withdrawal during contract gaps"
  - "Required Minimum Distributions when you reach retirement age"
  - "Continued exposure to market volatility"
- "These limitations are especially problematic for consultants whose income isn't as predictable as W-2 employees."

### The Hidden Math of Market Losses
**[SLIDE: The Hidden Math of Market Losses]**
- "There's another serious issue with traditional market-based accounts that most financial advisors don't talk about: the devastating impact of market losses."
- "Consider this simple example:"
  - "You start with $10 in the market"
  - "The market has a bad year and drops 50% - how much do you have left? You only have $5 left."
  - "The next year, things recovered and the market went up 50%. How much are you at now? Most think $10, but you're actually only at $7.50."
- "This is a mathematical reality that catches many people by surprise. When you lose money in the market, you need a much bigger gain just to get back to where you started."
- "If you lose 20% of your money, you need a 25% gain just to break even. But if you lose 50% of your money, you need a 100% gain - the market has to double - just to get back to zero!"
- "We all saw this play out in 2008. The market crashed 38.5%, then gained 23.5% in 2009. But investors were still significantly underwater, and many people needed years to recover those losses."
- "For consultants, this recovery time is especially problematic. If the market crashes during a gap between contracts when you might need access to funds, you're forced into a terrible choice: either sell at a loss or struggle financially while waiting for recovery."

## INTRODUCING INDEX ACCOUNTS (7-10 minutes)

**[SLIDE: Introducing Index Accounts]**
- "So here's where things get interesting. What if there was a financial vehicle specifically designed to address the consultant's dilemma? What if you could participate when the market goes up, but completely avoid the losses when it goes down, while maintaining access to your money during contract gaps? That's exactly what index accounts offer."
- "An index account is linked to the market but not directly invested in it. This creates a contractual agreement with two crucial features that are particularly valuable for consultants:"
  - "First, you will NEVER lose money due to market performance. That's a contractual guarantee, which provides incredible peace of mind when your income fluctuates between contracts."
  - "Second, when the market goes up, your money increases with it - the company just takes a little off the top for themselves."
- "Unlike traditional investments where you're riding the market roller coaster with no safety rail, index accounts give you protection on the downside while still letting you capture gains. This stability is crucial for consultants who can't afford to see their accumulated wealth disappear during a market downturn that coincides with a gap between contracts."
- "Let me show you how this works with a real example many of us remember:"
- "In 2000, the dotcom bubble burst and the market dropped 10.1%. Then 2001, down again. And 2002, down again. Three straight down years! But with an index account? Your money stayed right where it was - 0% each year. No losses. Then in 2003, when the market finally rebounded it went up 26.4%, this index account gained 11.2%."
- "So when the market drops, your money stays put. When it rises, you capture a portion of those gains. This is why I tell my clients 'Zero is your hero' - because never losing money is incredibly powerful for consultants who need both growth AND stability."

### Index Account Performance
**[SLIDE: Index Account Performance]**
- "Let's look at an even more powerful example: the 2008 financial crisis - something most of us remember all too well, and something that devastated many consultants' businesses and personal finances simultaneously."
- "In 2008, the market absolutely crashed - down 38.5%. Talk about a devastating loss! But index accounts? They stayed right at 0%. Not a penny lost."
- "Then in 2009, when the market started recovering and went up 23.5% (which wasn't enough to get traditional investors back to break even), index accounts captured returns between 8.8% and 17.5% depending on which specific index they were tracking."
- "Imagine being a consultant during that time. While others were watching their retirement accounts plummet and possibly being forced to take on any available contract just to make ends meet, those with funds in index accounts maintained their financial foundation. This gave them the freedom to be selective about contracts, negotiate better rates, or even take time off if needed."
- "Now here's where it gets really interesting. When we look at the historical 20-year averages across different index accounts, the numbers tell a compelling story:"
  - "Some indexes averaged 7.0% or 7.3%"
  - "Others performed even better at 8.1% or 10.0%"
  - "And one even delivered a 12.0% average return"
- "When you take all five of these indexes together, the average comes out to 8.88% - and remember, these returns were achieved with absolutely zero downside risk. Your principal is always contractually protected."
- "This is the key advantage that most financial advisors never talk about, especially to consultants: You might capture slightly less of the upside in the very best years, but you never, ever have to recover from losses. You're always moving forward, never backward."
- "Think about how this changes everything for a consultant's financial planning - no more roller coaster, no more hoping you don't have a contract gap during a market crash, just a steady, predictable growth pattern over time. That's what creates real financial confidence when your income isn't guaranteed."

## THE BUSINESS RETIREMENT VAULT STRATEGY (10-12 minutes)

**[SLIDE: The Business Retirement Vault Strategy]**
- "Now let's talk about what I call the Business Retirement Vault - or BRV - strategy. This is where everything we've been discussing comes together to create a perfect solution for consultants."
- "So what exactly is the Business Retirement Vault? It's a specially designed financial vehicle - specifically a Max-Funded Indexed Universal Life Insurance policy that's structured to maximize cash value growth and capture powerful tax advantages that most consultants never utilize."
- "These tax advantages come directly from IRS Tax Code 101(a) - which creates three game-changing benefits for consultants:"
  - "First, your money grows completely tax-free - no taxes on the gains. For consultants who are already paying significant self-employment taxes, this tax advantage is substantial."
  - "Second, you can access your money through policy loans without triggering tax events. This is crucial during those inevitable gaps between contracts or when you need capital for your life or business."
  - "And third, the death benefit passes to your heirs tax-free, creating a legacy regardless of the consulting income cycles you've experienced."
- "But the benefits go well beyond just taxes:"
  - "You get that zero-loss guaranteed protection we talked about earlier - essential when your income fluctuates"
  - "You have the growth potential from those index-linked returns without downside risk"
  - "You maintain complete liquidity - access to your funds when contracts end or opportunities arise"
  - "You keep total control - you decide how and when to use your money based on your needs"
  - "And you create an efficient wealth transfer to your family or heirs"
- "What makes the BRV strategy completely different from typical life insurance is our holistic structuring approach. Instead of what most advisors do - maximizing death benefit at the lowest cost - we strategically minimize the death benefit while maximizing cash value growth under IRS guidelines. We custom-design each plan to accelerate funding within tax law parameters, allowing you to build accessible cash value and create tax-free income streams in just a few years, not decades."
- "For consultants, this means creating a financial foundation that remains stable regardless of contract status, while providing both long-term growth and immediate accessibility when needed. We can even integrate existing retirement accounts and other assets into this strategy, ensuring your money is always productive while maintaining the liquidity consultants require during business transitions."

### Real IUL Performance - Case Study
**[SLIDE: Real IUL Performance: $250K Case Study]**
- "Let me show you a real-world example that really brings this to life."
- "Here's a case study for a 50-year-old who contributes $25,000 a year for 10 years - that's a total of $250,000. The policy is designed to credit at a 6.55% rate - which is actually conservative compared to the 8.88% historical average we just saw."
- "Now let's look at what happens:"
  - "After 10 years, they've built over $265k in cash value - a solid foundation that remains accessible."
  - "At age 62, they can take $29,052 in tax-free income every year - providing stable income regardless of workloads"
  - "Over their lifetime, that adds up to a potential $1.7 million in tax-free income"
  - "And while taking that income, the cash value doesn't deplete - it actually grows to $508k by age 70"
- "Let's break this down year by year:"
  - "By year 10 (age 60): They've got $265,195 cash value, though they're not taking income yet"
  - "By year 20 (age 70): Their cash value has grown to $508,531 while taking $29,052 annually"
  - "And by year 40 (age 90): Their cash value has increased to $2,280,093 while still taking that same $29,052 every year"
- "For consultants, this creates something traditional financial vehicles can't: predictable, tax-free income that isn't dependent on having active contracts, plus access to capital during their working years. Think about what this means - $250,000 contributed over 10 years generates nearly $30,000 of annual tax-free income for decades, while the cash value continues to grow instead of depleting. That's the power of becoming your own bank."

## THE SELF BANKING CONCEPT (8-10 minutes)

**[SLIDE: The Self Banking Concept]**
- "Now I want to share what I consider the most powerful feature of the BRV strategy, the concept of becoming your own bank. This is what really sets this approach apart and addresses the unique challenges of consulting income."
- "Let me show you exactly how this works, using our example of $265,195 in your BRV after those first 10 years:"
- "It's a three-step process that changes everything about how your money works for you:"
  - "Step 1: You access your money when you need it. You take out what's called an index loan for $265k. The loan interest rate is about 3.2% - that's roughly $8,500 per year"
  - "Step 2: Here's the twist - your money STILL grows inside the policy. That original $265,195 continues growing at around 6.5%. That's about $17,000 per year in growth tax free"
- "The bottom line? You're earning around $17,000 while paying around $8,500 in interest. That gives you roughly $8,500 in net cash per year. And that's while you're using your $265,195 elsewhere!"
- "This is the true magic of becoming your own bank. You get to use your money for whatever you need - covering expenses during contract gaps, investing in your business, or handling personal financial needs - while that same money continues growing inside the policy."
- "Think about this real-life example: A 50-year-old consultant builds up $265,195 after 10 years. They can take about $29,000 per year in tax-free income. Their account value grows to over $500,000 by age 70. Over their lifetime, that could amount to over $1.7 million in tax-free income."
- "For consultants, this solves the impossible choice between growth and access. You're not just earning a return - you're creating a financial system that works for you through both active contract periods and those inevitable gaps."

### BRV vs. Traditional Approach
**[SLIDE: BRV vs. Traditional Approach]**
- "Now let's compare the Business Retirement Vault strategy to the traditional 401(k)/IRA approach. This is where the differences really become clear for consultants."
- "Both approaches start with the same $250,000 over 10 years. But what happens next is dramatically different:"
  - "After 10 years: The traditional approach shows about $360,000 - which looks better at first glance. The BRV shows about $265,000 - which seems smaller initially."
  - "But when we look at the income: The traditional approach gives you around $13,000 per year after taxes. The BRV gives you around $29,000 per year completely tax-free."
- "That's more than double the income! And here's what happens over time:"
  - "With the traditional approach, your account value decreases every year as you take withdrawals"
  - "With the BRV, your account value actually increases to over $500,000 by age 70, even while you're taking income!"
- "For consultants specifically:"
  - "Traditional approach: You're exposed to market crashes (potentially during contract gaps)"
  - "BRV approach: You have zero-loss protection regardless of market conditions"
- "When it comes to accessing your money:"
  - "Traditional approach: Limited access, penalties, required distributions"
  - "BRV approach: Complete control - it's your money, use it when contracts end or opportunities arise"
- "This is why the BRV makes so much sense for consultants - it transforms retirement planning into true wealth building with complete control, regardless of your contract cycles."

### Client Success Story
**[SLIDE: Client Success Story]**
- "Let me share a quick real-life example that shows the power of this strategy specifically for consultants."
- "My client Karen is a consultant who was completely focused on growing her business with almost no retirement planning. She had some money in an IRA but no real strategy for handling the inconsistent income that came with her consulting work."
- "When we showed her how much of her retirement savings would be lost to taxes, and how inaccessible her money would be during contract gaps, she was stunned. This was something her previous financial advisor had never explained."
- "We helped her implement the Business Retirement Vault, and just three years later, it proved its value in a way that traditional accounts never could. When her son needed $7,000 to pay off his car during a period when she was at the end of one of her major contracts, she was able to borrow the money from her policy tax-free in less than a week."
- "The loan rate was just 3.2%, and remarkably, that $7,000 she borrowed continued growing inside her policy as if she never touched it. This gave her incredible peace of mind knowing she could help her family without disrupting her long-term financial strategy."
- "She's now repaying the loan on her own terms with no fixed schedule, while building significant tax-free wealth for her future. And most importantly, she's no longer stressed about contract gaps because she knows she has a financial foundation that works regardless of her consulting schedule."
- "This is the Business Retirement Vault in action for consultants – providing both immediate liquidity when life happens and long-term financial security without compromise."

## Q&A SESSION (5-10 minutes)

- "Now, I'd like to open the floor for questions. This is your opportunity to get clarity on anything we've discussed today or ask about how the Business Retirement Vault might apply to your specific situation as a consultant."

**[SLIDE: Common Questions]**
- "I want to start by answering some of the questions I get most often from clients. While I'm going through these, please feel free to type any other questions you have into the chat. I'll keep an eye on the chat and address as many of your individual questions as I can in the next few minutes."

### Common Questions and Answers
1. "How is this different from a Roth IRA?"
   - "Unlike Roth IRAs, there's no 59½ age restriction or 5-year waiting period to access your money. You have complete flexibility with no contribution limits, while still enjoying tax-free growth and distributions. This gives consultants access during contract gaps without penalties."

2. "What are the health qualification requirements?"
   - "Requirements vary by company, but here's what's important: our strategy focuses on cash value growth, not maximum insurance. We've developed approaches that work for most health situations. Even if you're not in perfect health, we can typically find a solution that delivers similar returns while meeting your goals."

3. "How quickly can I access my money?"
   - "We can structure your plan for accessibility in the first year if needed, or design it for longer-term growth. Like any financial vehicle, allowing time for growth is ideal, but we customize the accessibility timeline based on your specific cash flow needs."

4. "What happens if I can't make payments during a period of time?"
   - "This is exactly why we create flexible plans. We strategically structure them to accommodate the variable income patterns of consulting. Your plan can be designed with built-in flexibility to handle those inevitable contract gaps without derailing your whole long-term strategy."

5. "How customizable is this for my situation or business?"
   - "Complete customization is the cornerstone of our approach. Every plan is built specifically for your unique situation, contract cycles, and goals. This level of customization is why we limit the number of clients we work with each year – these aren't off-the-shelf solutions."

6. "What are the tax implications of policy loans?"
   - "Policy loans remain tax-free as long as the policy stays in force. We carefully structure your plan to avoid creating what's called a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC), which would change the tax treatment. This ensures your access to funds maintains its tax-free status."

7. "How does the 'zero-loss' protection work?"
   - "Your money is tied to an index account with a contractual floor of zero. The company measures performance on a year-to-year basis. If the market goes up, you participate in those gains. If the market goes down, your principal remains intact. This creates steady, consistent growth over time without the setbacks of market losses."

8. "What happens if tax laws change?"
   - "Life insurance taxation has remained fundamentally unchanged since World War II. Because these policies are legally defined as life insurance – not investments – they operate under a different section of the tax code. The death benefit structure ensures they maintain their tax advantages despite changing political environments."
